    <p>I Kissed the Girl</p>
    <p>Katy Perry</p>
        <p><h2>Letra:</h2>
            This was never the way I planned
            <br>
            Not my intention
            <br>
            I got so brave, drink in hand
            <br>
            Lost my discretion
            <br>
            It's not what I'm used to
            <br>
            Just wanna try you on
            <br>
            I'm curious for you
            <br>
            Caught my attention
            <br>
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            The taste of her cherry chapstick
            <br>
            I kissed a girl just to try it
            <br>
            I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
            <br>
            It felt so wrong, it felt so right
            <br>
            Don't mean I'm in love tonight
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            I liked it
            <br>
            <br>
            No, I don't even know your name
            <br>
            It doesn't matter
            <br>
            You're my experimental game
            <br>
            Just human nature
            <br>
            It's not what good girls do
            <br>
            Not how they should behave
            <br>
            My head gets so confused
            <br>
            Hard to obey
            <br>
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            The taste of her cherry chapstick
            <br>
            I kissed a girl just to try it
            <br>
            I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
            <br>
            It felt so wrong, it felt so right
            <br>
            Don't mean I'm in love tonight
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            I liked it
            <br>
            <br>
            Us girls, we are so magical
            <br>
            Soft skin, red lips, so kissable
            <br>
            Hard to resist, so touchable
            <br>
            Too good to deny it
            <br>
            Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
            <br>
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            The taste of her cherry chapstick
            <br>
            I kissed a girl just to try it
            <br>
            I hope my boyfriend don't mind it
            <br>
            It felt so wrong, it felt so right
            <br>
            Don't mean I'm in love tonight
            <br>
            I kissed a girl and I liked it
            <br>
            I liked it
           </p>
