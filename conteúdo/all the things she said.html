            All the things she said (all the things she said)
            <br>
            This is not enough (enough, enough, enough)
            <br>
            <br>
            I'm in serious shit, I feel totally lost
            <br>
            If I'm asking for help it's only because
            <br>
            Being with you has opened my eyes
            <br>
            Could I ever believe such a perfect surprise?
            <br>
            <br>
            I keep asking myself, wondering how
            <br>
            I keep closing my eyes but I can't block you out
            <br>
            Want to fly to a place where it's just you and me
            <br>
            Nobody else, so we can be free
            <br>

            This is not enough
            <br>
            <br>
            All the things she said

            All the things she said
            <br>
            <br>
            And I'm all mixed up, feeling cornered and rushed
            <br>
            They say it's my fault but I want her so much
            <br>
            Want to fly her away where the sun and rain
            <br>
            Come in over my face, wash away all the shame
            <br>
            When they stop and stare, don't worry me
            <br>
            'Cause I'm feeling for her what she's feeling for me
            <br>
            I can try to pretend, I can try to forget
            <br>
            But it's driving me mad, going out of my head
            <br>
            <br>
            All the things she said
            <br>
