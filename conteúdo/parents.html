        Blah!
        <br>
        <br>
        I was born in a messed up century
        <br>
        My favourite flavoured sweets are raspberry amphetamines
        <br>
        I bought a car, Beretta, age 16
        <br>
        I brush my teeth with bleach
        <br>
        'Cause I ain't got time for cavities
        <br>
        <br>
        My daddy put a gun to my head
        <br>
        Said, "If you kiss a boy I'm gonna shoot you dead"
        <br>
        So I tied him up with gaffa tape
        <br>
        And locked him in a shed
        <br>
        Then I went out to the garden
        <br>
        And I fucked my best friend
        <br>
        <br>
        'Cause my
        <br>
        High hopes are getting low because these people are so old
        <br>
        The way they think about it all
        <br>
        I tried I would never know
        <br>
        My high hopes are getting low
        <br>
        But I know I'll never be alone
        <br>
        It's alright, we'll survive
        <br>
        'Cause parents ain't always right
        <br>
        <br>
        Drop a toaster in my bath
        <br>
        Watch my mum and dad laugh
        <br>
        See a thousand volts go through the son they wish they never had
        <br>
        They told me casual affection leads to sexual infection
        <br>
        But it's hard to get an erection
        <br>
        When you're so used to rejection
        <br>
        <br>
        Yeah, the teacher fucked the preacher
        <br>
        But then he had to leave her
        <br>
        Had to wash away the sins
        <br>
        Of a male cheerleader
        <br>
        Hi, nice to meet ya, got nothing to believe in
        <br>
        So let me know when my breathing stops
        <br>
        <br>
        'Cause my
        <br>
        High hopes are getting low because these people are so old
        <br>
        The way they think about it all
        <br>
        If I tried I would never know
        <br>
        My high hopes are getting low
        <br>
        But I know I'll never be alone
        <br>
        It's alright, we'll survive
        <br>
        'Cause parents ain't always right
        <br>
        <br>
        Tick, tock, stop the clock
        <br>
        Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot
        <br>
        Tick, tock, stop the clock
        <br>
        Because I get the feeling that I'm gonna get shot
        <br>
        <br>
        My
        <br>
        High hopes are getting low because these people are so old
